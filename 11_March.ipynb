    "Q1: The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the information available about the population being sampled. \n",
    "\n",
    "A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and needs to be estimated from the sample. It is typically used for smaller sample sizes. For example, if you want to compare the mean weights of two groups of individuals (e.g., Group A and Group B) with sample sizes below 30, you would use a t-test. The t-test takes into account the variability in the sample data and provides a test statistic that follows a t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known or when the sample size is large (typically above 30). It assumes that the population follows a normal distribution. For example, if you have a large sample size and want to compare the mean heights of two groups (e.g., Group X and Group Y), you can use a z-test. The z-test uses the known population standard deviation and provides a test statistic that follows a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: One-tailed and two-tailed tests refer to the directionality of the hypothesis being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a one-tailed test, the hypothesis specifies a directional relationship between the variables being tested. It focuses on whether the sample mean is significantly greater than or less than a certain value. The one-tailed test is appropriate when there is prior knowledge or a specific expectation about the direction of the effect being tested. For example, if a researcher wants to test whether a new treatment improves test scores and expects the treatment to increase scores, they would use a one-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a two-tailed test, the hypothesis does not specify a direction. It tests whether the sample mean is significantly different from a certain value, regardless of whether it is greater or less. The two-tailed test is appropriate when there is no specific expectation about the direction of the effect. For example, if a researcher wants to test whether a new teaching method affects test scores without any prior expectation, they would use a two-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Type 1 and Type 2 errors are related to hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 error, also known as a \"false positive,\" occurs when you reject a true null hypothesis. In other words, you conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when, in reality, there is none. The probability of committing a Type 1 error is denoted by α (alpha), which represents the significance level of the test. For example, let's say a pharmaceutical company tests a new drug, and they wrongly conclude that the drug is effective (rejecting the null hypothesis) when it actually has no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 error, also known as a \"false negative,\" occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. In this case, you conclude that there is no significant effect or difference when, in reality, there is one. The probability of committing a Type 2 error is denoted by β (beta). For example, if a new diagnostic test fails to detect a disease (not rejecting the null hypothesis) when the person is actually affected.\n",

    "Q4: Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes how to update the probability of an event based on new evidence or information. The theorem is stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of event A given evidence B.\n",
    "- P(B|A) is the probability of evidence B given event A.\n",
    "- P(A) is the prior probability of event A.\n",
    "- P(B) is the probability of evidence B.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, Bayes's theorem allows you to update your beliefs or probabilities about an event based on new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example: Let's say you are concerned about having a rare disease that affects 1% of the population. You take a diagnostic test for the disease, and the test has a 95% accuracy rate (i.e., the probability of a positive test result given that you have the disease is 95%). The probability of a positive test result in the general population (including both those with and without the disease) is 2%. Using Bayes's theorem, you can calculate the probability of actually having the disease given a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) = (P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease)) / P(Positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Positive|Disease) = 0.95 (test accuracy)\n",
    "P(Disease) = 0.01 (prevalence in the population)\n",
    "P(Positive) = 0.02 (probability of a positive test result)\n",
    "\n",
    "By plugging in these values, you can calculate the posterior probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides an estimate of the precision or uncertainty associated with the sample statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, you need the sample statistic (e.g., sample mean), the standard deviation (or standard error) of the population, the desired confidence level, and the distribution associated with the sample statistic (usually the t-distribution or z-distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example: Let's say you want to estimate the average height of a certain population. You collect a sample of 100 individuals and calculate the sample mean height to be 175 cm, with a standard deviation of 5 cm. You want to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the t-distribution (since the population standard deviation is unknown), you would determine the critical value associated with a 95% confidence level for the desired degrees of freedom. Let's assume it is 1.98.\n",

    "Confidence Interval = sample mean ± (critical value * standard error)\n",

    "Confidence Interval = 175 ± (1.98 * 0.5) = (174.01, 175.99)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: With 95% confidence, we estimate that the true population mean height lies between 174.01 cm and 175.99 cm.\n",

    "Q6: To demonstrate the application of Bayes's theorem, consider the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say a certain medical test is used to detect a rare disease, which affects 1 in every 10,000 people in the population. The test has a sensitivity of 95%, meaning it correctly identifies the disease 95% of the time. However, the test also has a false positive rate of 2%, meaning it incorrectly indicates the presence of the disease in 2% of healthy individuals. Suppose you test positive for the disease. What is the probability that you actually have the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes's theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) = (P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease)) / P(Positive)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Positive|Disease) = 0.95 (test sensitivity)\n",
    "P(Disease) = 1/10,000 (prevalence in the population)\n",
    "P(Positive) = P(Positive|Disease) * P(Disease) + P(Positive|No Disease) * P(No\n",
    "\n",
    "Disease)\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Positive|No Disease) = 0.02 (false positive rate)\n",
    "P(No Disease) = 1 - P(Disease) = 1 - 1/10,000 = 9,999/10,000\n",
    "\n",
    "By substituting the values into the equation, we can calculate the probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) = (0.95 * (1/10,000)) / [(0.95 * (1/10,000)) + (0.02 * (9,999/10,000))]\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the numerator:\n",
    "0.95 * (1/10,000) ≈ 9.5e-05\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the denominator:\n",
    "(0.95 * (1/10,000)) + (0.02 * (9,999/10,000)) ≈ 9.5e-05 + 0.019995\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive) ≈ 9.5e-05 / (9.5e-05 + 0.019995) ≈ 0.0047\n",

    "Therefore, given a positive test result, the probability of actually having the disease is approximately 0.47% (or 0.0047).\n",

    "Q7: To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, we can use the formula for the confidence interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = sample mean ± (critical value * standard error)\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value depends on the desired confidence level and the sample size. For a 95% confidence level and a large sample size (typically considered above 30), we can use the standard normal distribution and a critical value of approximately 1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard error = standard deviation / √(sample size)\n",
    "Standard error = 5 / √(sample size)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming a sample size of 100 for this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard error = 5 / √100 = 5 / 10 = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval = 50 ± (1.96 * 0.5) = (49.02, 50.98)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: With 95% confidence, we estimate that the true population mean lies between 49.02 and 50.98.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: The margin of error in a confidence interval represents the range of values above and below the point estimate (e.g., sample mean) that is likely to contain the true population parameter. It indicates the level of uncertainty associated with the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error depends on the desired confidence level and the variability of the data. A higher confidence level will result in a larger margin of error, indicating a wider interval with more precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size affects the margin of error inversely. As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. This is because larger sample sizes provide more information and reduce the variability of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a survey conducted to estimate the proportion of people who support a certain policy. If the initial sample size is small, the margin of error will be relatively large, making the estimate less precise. However, if the sample size is increased, the margin of error will decrease, resulting in a more precise estimate.\n",

    "Q9: To calculate the z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5, we use the formula:\n",
